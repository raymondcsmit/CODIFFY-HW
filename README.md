Assignment
Create a frontend application using angular to manage a music record library. If you arenâ€™t familiar with records, he needs to track/store the following fields per-record (at a minimum): Artist, Album Title, Year, and Record Condition. The current list of albums are located at: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mslosarek/feb16b9a1dae5f3b7868ff0e0674d1c1/raw/06e0e0efebdaca724b7b70720d6d63ceff3acb19/page1.json
The application must meet a few requirements:
The application must be able to fetch and display albums in a paginated fashion.
These fields must be visible for each album: Artist Name, Album Title, Year, and Record Conditi
A user must be able to edit and update all the fields on an album, including the artists associated with the album. Don't worry about persisting edits on the server.
As a user, I should be able to update the Artist's name. Meaning if I update an Artist's name on one record, it should be updated across all records associated with that artist.
As a user, I want to filter my albums using a search query. The results should update as I type.
Add any bells and whistles you think would be helpful.
